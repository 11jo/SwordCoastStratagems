# SwordCoastStratagems
Sword Coast Stratagems (SCS) adds over 130 optional components to Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, Baldur's Gate Trilogy, mostly focused around improving monster AI and encounter difficulties, but also including cosmetic and ease-of-use components, tweaks to abilities or spells.

**PLEASE NOTE: **

This repository is purely for archival purposes, and my workflow happens offline, with updates being pushed to the repository only when a new release is made. SCS is not a collaborative project and I do not accept proposed fixes or changes via PR. If you want to report bugs or suggest fixes, please do so at the Gibberlings 3 forums.

The only exception to this is translation updates, and only when those updates just modify files in the lang/[your_language] file, i.e. do not attempt to update setup-stratagems.tp2.
