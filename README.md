# SwordCoastStratagems
Sword Coast Stratagems (SCS) adds over 130 optional components to Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, Baldur's Gate Trilogy, mostly focused around improving monster AI and encounter difficulties, but also including cosmetic and ease-of-use components, tweaks to abilities or spells.

PLEASE NOTE: 

1) I make no attempt to keep this repository in an installable state, and bug reports on unreleased commits are not useful to me.
2) I would vastly prefer to receive bugfixes and translations on the forums rather than by pull request. The latter tends to mess with my workflow, which is mostly offline.
