1,2,5, 50

Appear to be used in BG1 only

24

1) AMNCEN1, to signal an invisible character.
2) ILYICH, for something or other

33

1) Used for something specific in the player's Thief Guild (PGUILD only)

57

1) Used only by SHOUT, easily the most common help script (719 uses): shouts are made if attacked by or hit by the PC, are propagated and responded to by non-innocents, cause hostility in anyone hearing it. (NB SHOUT also causes response (but not hostility) on 99.)

68

1) Used only by SUMSHT02, which despite the name is basically a script for bears (including but not limited to summoned bears). 68 is shouted by any enemy who sees anyone, and causes hostility and response in non-innocent neutrals and hostility in innocent neutrals.

69

1) used by SUMSHT01 and SUMSHT02. The former is used only by panthers. 69 is shouted by ALLYs basically all the time and causes move-up.

79

Apparently unused in-game.

80-83

Used by a fairly involved network of AI-signallings in Duergar and Hobgoblin scripting. Also
used in the smuggler/paladin battle. In each case, probably leave well alone.

89

very widely used...

1) Used by GENSHT01, one of the main help scripts (401 uses). Shout if attacked by party or hit. GO hostile (if neutral) indiscriminately on hearing). If non-innocent, move up.
2) USed in basic go-hostile by Drizzt (DRIZZSHT), CAPTLOUT, 
3) Shouted (but not responded to) by GORMIM01-04, JANGIT01-02, JUGMIM01, MIMIC01, OBSHAL01, TRRAK03
4) used in a moderately complicated ILYICH script
5) used complicatedly by KAYPALx, KAYSMUGx
6) Used in MADULF and UHOGRE to shout, move up, go hostile, if GOODBUTBLUE (madulf also goes hostile if NEUTRAL on 99)
7) GENSHT behaviour replicated by SUMSHT01

99

again widely used

1) Shouted upon going hostile by COR, ENNA, ERLIN, EXTRAX, GAALSHT, SCREAMRU (which ties it to a more complicated scream-and-run routine) and by some of the duergar in Chateau Irenicus
2) DUEARC01, DUEGAU01, DUEGAU02, DUEMAG01, DUEMAG02 shout it on being attacked (if Neutral) and go hostile, and propagate, if they hear it.
3) Used by Shout: if 99 is heard by a non-innocent, go hostile, move up, and shout 57; if by an innocent, go hostile.
4) Shouted, and propagated, by Suldanesselar elves (they also shout it if an enemy is in their group).
5) Used by THFSHOUT to shout if attacked while an enemy, to shout and go invisible if attacked while neutral, to go invisible, hostile,  and move up if noninnocent and neutral, just to go invisible and hostile if neutral and innocent, and to move up if already hostile and noninnocent.



100


1) the demon summoner in Bridge district. Appears inert. DEMPRI
2) the SUELF elves. sh=>ho=>sh, SUELFW1-15, SUELFSHT
3) the fanatics with Viconia. sh=>ho=>sh VICG, VICG1, VICTOWN

101

1) the TERMER mercenaries: general help script  GENSHTJA

111

1) the slaver wizard, SLMAGE2, in AREAWARN (possibly some nonfunctional AI coding)
2) mage14T, for the same purpose

115

1) GP115, a general help script used only by Lord Alibakkar's men

116

1) GP116, a general help script used only by Lady Luraxxol's men

121,122 

1) used only in MDKSHOUT, a fairly complex multi-shout script

123 (aka HEALME)
124 (aka ASSIST)
125 (aka ALERT)

The ToB combat scripts use these essentially the same way (the scripts are
AMDUEL1.BCS
AMDUEL2.BCS
BALMONK.BCS
BALTHFT.BCS
CHALPC01.BCS
GPARCHER.BCS
GPHEALER.BCS
GPKENSAI.BCS

ASSIST is for help in combat when at "breakingpoint"
ALERT is shouted on being attacked by a PCtype (which also causes hostility), on being hit, or (once) on seeing a PC if already hostile. ALERT causes (indiscriminate) hostility and move-up but not propagation
HEALME is when badly hurt.


126 (aka SOLAR_STANCE)
(some Balthazar thing)

151

all over the place...

1) standard help code for baatezu and tanarri in WK: GORBAT1, GORCAMB2-5, GORTAN, GORTAN1. Shouted when hostile, triggers hostility and move-up.
2) used in GPDIE to shout on death
3) GPSHOUT, one of the game's primary help scripts, used in 337 creatures. Shouted when hit, when hostile and seeing PC, triggers hostility ONLY if non-innocent and in the same group as the shouter; includes some cosmetic shouting using 153 to whine.
4) used in SARBUL01-03, SARDW01-03, TRGRD01-04, TRGRD01-03, largely replicating structure of GPSHOUT (with a little extra content)
5) GRPSHT01, another primary help script (251 uses) has the same structure, and isn't obviously distinct from GPSHOUT

152 

1) Amkethran smugglers (AMSMUG01), unused DISRUP01, THIEF14T, THIEFRG, in each case shouted but not listened for

153

again very widely used...

1) Many HLA scripts: CARCH20B/30B, CBARD12A, CBERS20B, CFIGH20A, CFIGH20B, CKMAG02A, CMACL20A, CMAGE20A, CMAGE20B, CTHIE20A, CTHIE20B, KUOARC20, used in each case to whine for help but not listened for. Also in ELTAN, FIRLCH01, GORCAMB4/5, GORSTAM, SENGUA04-05, TIEF3, ZILMAG01
2) Used to whine, and responded to, by DAQDROW, SARBUL01-03, SARDW01-03, and the main scripts GPSHOUT, GRPSHT01

154

used in lots of places to implement a (fairly crude) run-away-from-area-effect algorithm. 


155

used in a couple of places to try to implement an avoid-clouds algorithm.


199

1) USed by the shadow druids (drdsht01 and faldorn). Implements an indiscriminate sh=>gh and see enemy/get hit => sh, moves towards source of shout if non-innocent
