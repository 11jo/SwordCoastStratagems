Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length.  The former resulted in what is now called the long bow.

This particular bow is made from an unusual wood from southern lands, much sought by bowyers: despite its small size, it is as accurate as a longbow and slightly more powerful.

A halberd can be best described as a cross between a spear and an axe.

It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip.  Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs.  The shaft is about 18 inches long. ''

Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

1) The character will fight, prioritising opponents who are not immobile and helpless, not fighting if they're trying to Turn Undead, and not wasting Melf's Minute Meteors, Energy Blades or 
Invisibility. You can shift the character between melee (D) and ranged weapons (F) using the hotkeys. If you'd rather that your character did not enter melee, you can toggle melee off by pressing (K). Characters with melee toggled off will fight if enemies are in weapon range but won't be proactive about getting into range.

2) The character will cast some long-duration spells when out of combat. There are 4 settings for this, which you can toggle through using (S). On setting 1, the character uses no spells. On setting 2 and up, the character will cast all of the following spells if they are memorized (and not already active): Stoneskin, Iron Skins, Armor, Melf's Minute Meteors, Goodberry. 

3) On setting 2 and up, the character will consume Goodberries if injured and out of combat. On setting 3 and up, the character will also consume potions of healing. On setting 4, the character will consume potions of extra-healing.

4) On setting 2 and up, the character will automatically activate the following items once per day: the Cloak of the Stars; the Gargoyle Boots; the Belt of Fortitude.

5) The character will cast some spells, by hotkey, on the whole party. This casting is highly accelerated, cannot be done in combat, and only casts on characters who are not already protected. Its main function is for later in the game when you can afford to carry enough spells to protect the whole party. The hot-keys are: C for Chaotic Commands; V for Death Ward; B for Protection from Fire, Protection from Lightning, and Protection from Magic Energy; Z for a paladin's Protection from Evil.~

@1405=~Okay, actually it is what you think. But you'll not take <CHARNAME> without a fight!~

@1602=~These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords.  In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era.  Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

@1604=~Why must we fight? Cannot let you leave knowing all this. We could have existed peacefully, but now you have fought and will never accept. Others will come to kill or capture. Adventurers like you always come, do they not? No, I must fight, and you must die! We may still have hope if Selaad returns, but you cannot help anymore.~
@1605=~Kaishas, we fought only because we were forced to. It was not our doing, but yours, and there is no need for it to go on.~
@1606=~We were forced to fight, Kaishas, and we fought well - do you really think you can stop us boarding this ship?~
@1607=~Your village and the tunnels beneath it are now filled with the corpses of your kind. If you really want to fight then so be it, but you're making a mistake.~
@1608=~Die, then - if you are a monster, I shall treat you as one.~
@1609=~Such generosity, but if you leave you will exterminate anyway. Others will come, other fools just to fight the "evil" we are. No, we must remain alone here now, and so must you. Die and sleep, and you will not know the loneliness. Perhaps if Selaad returns we will try again. Until then, we stay.~
@1610=~Kaishas, there is no need for this. This isn't my choice, but we'll kill you if we have to. Do you really think you can stop us where Karoug and Daese couldn't?~
@1611=~ I... fear that we cannot. But we shall try. No choice remains to us.~
@1612=~Kaishas, this is insane. You are going to your death, and I don't even want to kill you!~
@1613=~Perhaps not. But you are wounded and tired, and the pack is close behind you. Even adventurers can fight only so long. Regardless, it must be so. Truly, I am sorry.~
@1614=~I have reluctantly fought with Kaishas. She seemed to think there was no other way. She mentioned they might have a second chance if Selaad returned one day. He was their missing chieftain, if I remember correctly.~
@1615=~Perhaps monsters we are. But we do what we must to survive.~
@1616=~ You only remind me that this must be. Too much has happened between us. I do not know whether we can stop you or not, but the answer will be known swiftly.~
@1617=~What choice is there? If truth is known, ruin will come to us!~
@1618=~Then so be it.~
@1619=~You can trust us. We'll tell no-one about your people - it will be as if we never came to this place.~
@1620=~Die well... I am truly sorry that it ends this way.~
@1621=~How much I would like to believe you! But understand well, the future of my people is at stake here. I cannot take chances.~
@1622=~We've been risking our lives for your damn people every day since we washed up here! What more do we have to do to persuade you? How many more babies do we have to save from wolfweres? ~
@1623=~We've been risking our lives for your damn people every day since we washed up here! What more do we have to do to persuade you?~
@1624=~You can do nothing. Truly, I am sorry.~
@1625=~You... can do nothing. Maralee will be grateful forever for your deed.... as will I. But brave though it was, you did it without realising our true nature.~
@1626=~And now I do. Prepare yourself, Kaishas - this ends now.~
@1627=~This grows ridiculous. Your ingratitude sickens me - I'd hoped that I wouldn't need to see you as a monster, but it looks as if I was wrong.~
@1628=~Kaishas, do you take me for a fool? I knew you were werewolves before I even spoke to Karoug... frankly I was damn suspicious within five minutes of entering the village! If you're going to try to kill us then go right ahead, but for Ao's sake give us some credit for intelligence!~
@1629=~I give you much credit, for intelligence and bravery both. Yet a headwoman's duty is all. I cannot risk that you lie.~
@1630=~Kaishas, please, wait! <CHARNAME> isn't lying! <PRO_HESHE> and I grew close... long after <PRO_HESHE> must have realised the truth about us! Spare <PRO_HIMHER> - <PRO_HESHE> may know our nature, but <PRO_HESHE> will keep our secret.~
@1631=~ I...~
@1632=~Kaishas, my Peladan is still alive because of these outsiders. Do I have to let him grow up knowing that we slaughtered Peladan's saviour? That we are monsters in truth as well as form?~
@1633=~I... I have been a fool. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, that I brought us to the brink of kinship with the beasts. But we are better than Karoug... thank you for knowing that, even as I forgot it.~
@1634=~Go, in peace. I do not know what will befall when you confront my husband. Greatly I fear for him, but he brings his fate upon himself. If he will not take back the gift willingly... then you must do what you must do.~
@1635=~One day, I hope, Peladan will have a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. <PRO_HISHER> name will be "<CHARNAME>".~
@1636=~We will never meet again, <CHARNAME> It.. grieves me. Remember me, even as you forget all else about our people.~
@1637=~I managed to persuade Kaishas Gan to let us leave in peace... with a bit of help from Delainy. A lovely girl, but some things are not meant to be, I suppose.~
@1638=~I managed to persuade Kaishas Gan to let us leave in peace... with a bit of help from Durlyle. There was something special between us... but some things are not meant to be, I suppose.~
@1639=~Indeed it does. Truly, I am sorry.~
@1640=~You shame me, outsider. Great is our debt to you. Yet a headwoman's duty is all. I cannot risk that you lie.~
@1641=~You have returned! And you are pack... I smell it on you. But where is Kaishas? Where is my mate?~
@1642=~Why did you send us? What was meant to happen on that island?~
@1643=~She remained on the island. Your mate would have killed us when we rejected the curse she laid upon us... but at the last she saw wisdom. Lift the "gift" from us and return to her, "Mendas". There is nothing here for you.~
@1644=~The log book was nothing! Balduran was nothing! He refused the gift that grandfathers offered him. You were only to give sea charts to Kaishas and kill Karoug so he could not follow. Kaishas would have brought pack here, where I have prepare place for them. Miserable ones! You could not accomplish such simple things? Instead you abandon my family and steal the boat to save your cruel selves?~
@1645=~It is time to end this banter now, Mendas. It is time that you pay for your lies and your evil. Prepare to die.~
@1646=~This ends here. Lift the "gift" from us, Mendas, and return to your mate. There is nothing here for you.~
@1647=~Dogs! You are not fit to die at my hand but die you shall! To me, Baresh! A bloody reckoning is at hand!~
@1648=~The mystery of this island has become clear. Mendas/Selaad sent us to the island on the false pretenses of retrieving evidence from what was believed to be Balduran's shipwreck. It was indeed the adventurer's ship, though his personal fate yet remains a mystery. Balduran's crew were infected with lycanthropy sometime during that fateful voyage. The ship was beached and wrecked leaving the two strains of lycanthropes, werewolves and wolfweres, to fight amongst themselves for survival. The more organized werewolves built the village that we recently shipwrecked near on our own fateful voyage. The chaotic wolfweres took residence in the ruins of Balduran's ship and both packs survived in uneasy co-existence since then. Mendas/Selaad eventually took the risk of sailing for the mainland. Somehow he made it and, upon discovering that someone had finally found the island, made up a plausible tale and had us first steal the sea charts, and later travel to the island to put them in his werewolf mate's hands. She had us kill the wolfweres and then infected the party with lycanthropy, intending us to join the pack or die fighting, but we persuaded her to let us leave peacefully. We sailed home to finally discover the truth of Mendas' duplicity. Fate seems to enjoy toying with me.~
@1649=~I am puzzled, Mendas, or should I say Selaad. Since you are the leader of the werewolves, why did you not sail back to the island yourself?~
@1650=~I am no sailor. I stay to prepare place for my people. For generations we have been trapped on island. It is time to return home to the land of grandfathers' birth. They needed charts and I needed adventurers who do not ask too much questions. Yet you have failed. I ask again - where is Kaishas?~
@1651=~"Lift" it? My foolish mate, what have you told them? It is not a curse to be lifted - it is a gift to be savoured! It can only be "cured" by killing the chieftain of the werewolves. I am chieftain and I judge you unworthy to run with my pack. You will die here today. To me Baresh! A bloody reckoning is at hand!~
@1652=~Selaad Gan is the chief of the true people. He awaits the return of his mate Kaishas. Why have you not returned with her?~
@1653=~It is not your place to question me. What part do you play in this?~
@1654=~It seems that we have been deceived. Kaishas is dead and her murderous ilk died with her.~
@1655=~We were hired to retrieve the logbook of Balduran. Here we have brought it and now we expect payment.~
@1656=~It seems that we have been deceived. Kaishas remains on the island. We must confront Selaad and have him remove this curse which his mate has foolishly bestowed upon us.~
@1657=~The master wishes to see his wife, Kaishas Gan. Is she on the vessel still?~
@1658=~It is not your business. Step aside.~
@1659=~Who is your master? We work for Mendas of Waterdeep.~
@1660=~I am Baresh. I am of the true race as you are not. The master wishes to see his wife, Kaishas Gan. Is she on the vessel still?~
@1661=~The book is nothing! Thy task was to rescue the master's kin. Where is the master's mate, Kaishas?~
@1662=~Thy task was clear. Travel to the island-home and retrieve master's kin. Failing that, Kaishas was to take the sea charts from thee. Useless manlings! Selaad does not brook failure well.~
@1663=~Idiot! We were sent on false pretences and somehow it is our fault? Kaishas attacked us and we were forced to defend ourselves. Mendas was betrayed by his own cleverness.~
@1664=~Mendas deceived us. He is the one that we must confront. You are merely a flunky.~
@1665=~Idiot! We were sent on false pretences and somehow it is our fault? Now, take us to Selaad!~

@1903=~Aye, I guess, but I'll not be long about it. The acolytes I mentioned, they stay with Thaldorn on the fifth floor. Eight of them, there are, and their madness comes in pairs: two priests, two mages, two assassins, two hardened thugs. But there is something wrong about them... if they were here for the simple joys of a pretty coin, I'd have no quarrel with them. But no: they would not deign to be so human. There is something more, some secret agenda and I know not what... Ack, even now I can feel their pestilential eyes upon me. Your lucre can keep me here no longer, I'm afraid.~
@1904=~Mmn, hello. You must be the city negotiators... Lemme see on the list, here: Emissary... Emissary Tar? Right on time and a pleasure to meet you. My name is Destus Gurn, Assistant Chief Accountant for the Iron Throne's operations on the Sword Coast. Now, just a quick briefing on our negotiating procedures before you head on up the stairs: Thaldorn will be accompanied by a board of eight Iron Throne advisors sent to us from abroad: Zhalimar Cloudwulfe, Gardush, Naaman, Diyab, Shennara, Kaalos, Aasim, and Alai, all of them quite respectable people and eager to meet you. We also have a ninth member on that board, today, a Mr. Lyle Espejo. He is there to ensure that things go smoothly in this time of transition. As for the agenda...~
@1905=~Those before us were fools, as you are.  Those before us were weak, as you are.  Those before us were not Zhalimar, or Gardush, or Naaman, or Diyab, or Shennara, or Kaalos, or Aasim, or Alai.  Those before us are dead, as you will be.  So it has been decreed; so it shall be done.  So orders Sarevok!~
@1906=~I am sorry to bring back such painful memories.  I wish to help you, and in doing so, end these dreams that plague me.  Here, take this.  When you do battle against the eight who serve your father's killer, read this scroll and it will protect you from their wrath.  Goodbye now; perhaps we shall meet again.~

@2003=~Our dead father's strength suffuses these walls! Here I was to perform the rituals that would make me a god, and here I have already mastered power beyond your puny imaginings. What I began with Zhalimar and the others whom you struck down in Rieltar's mansion, I have now completed.~
@2004=~These four are my acolytes, the first of my worshippers. While we are within this place, their souls are bound to our father's taint within me. Their power suffuses me, protects me from all harm. It is but a taste of what I shall wield when I ascend, but for now it is more than sufficient to end this little family quarrel.~
@2005=~Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. I shall not allow your death to be swift.~
@2006=~A predictable ploy, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. And impressive, as well, but ultimately futile. I have three others - and before too long, I will have legions.~
@2007=~But until then, one must not be wasteful. Come, my acolyte! Your body shall serve me yet!~
@2008=~Does it end here, then, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>? You have taken my acolytes, taken my shield from harm. Am I not to become a god?~

@2102 = ~Someone approaches! Perhaps another errant member of the family? But we had better be prepared, just in case... these parts are dangerous, you know, brother.~
@2103= ~Yes, I know, you probably all think I'm carried away, all this magic and all. But I wouldn't want you to get hurt... to get...~
@2104= ~You there, what is the meaning of this...~

@2201=~Ho there, <CHARNAME>! Your foster father Gorion tells me that you need to leave the Keep at once. Your very life is in danger and there is no time to lose.~
@2202=~But before then, it's probably a good idea if you go round the Keep in a leisurely fashion finding lost property and running errands, all for an economically implausible cash reward and an astonishing amount of experience.~
@2203=~Sounds good, I'm on it.~
@2204=~Can't I just get the cash and experience right now? The longer I wait, the higher the chance that those first-level assassins in the Keep will finish me off.~
@2205=~Good luck, <CHARNAME>, and watch out for those rats. See you in Chapter Six.~
@2206=~I don't see why not. How much are you really going to learn about spell-throwing and swordplay by fetching crossbow bolts, after all?~
@2207=~Here's the cash and a couple of potions, and some random junk that you can probably sell to someone. Go do your shopping, then I'll take you to Gorion.~
@2208=~Ready to go, <CHARNAME>?~
@2209=~Yep, take me to Gorion.~
@2210=~No, I haven't finished shopping yet.~
@2211=~Actually, I thought I'd go and do all the quests anyway, and get twice the experience.~
@2212=~Right this way.~
@2213=~Very well, <CHARNAME>, but get a move on, I don't have all day.~
@2214=~In any case, you don't realise just how dangerous it is here for you. Those bounty hunters can do up to one point of damage per blow!~

In addition, when this script is active, pressing F shifts the selected character(s) to missile weapons, and pressing D shifts non-mage characters to melee weapons (this can be useful when roaming the wilderness, where you might want everyone except your mage to charge enemy archers).

@2503=~Well, if it isn't another winter wolf pelt! Thing is, I had a buyer lined up for the last one... don't think I can be taking another one off your hands right now. Maybe some trader a bit closer to civilization could help you out. But perhaps I can interest you in something else?~

@3002= ~Regardless of Gorion's teachings, I have decided that it is not the best time for you to rejoin with me.~
@3003= ~As well it should be.  Gorion taught you as best he could, and evidently some of that knowledge has stuck after all.~
@3004= ~Then I shall await the day when your senses return to you, for it is foolish to disregard such helpful and righteous allies.~
@3005= ~I knew you would return!  Rejoin with Minsc and Boo, and we shall once more charge headlong into adventure and glory!~
@3006= ~I have no desire to put my head in that kind of jeopardy.  Perhaps another time.~
@3007= ~It has been quite the boring trip without you.  Welcome back.~

@3013= ~Your expertise is welcome.  Travel with me, will you?~
@3014= ~I have no words to express my disappointment.  Perhaps another time, then.~
@3015= ~That is a wise and beneficial decision for all concerned.~

@3018= ~Aye, that I do.~
@3019= ~I have no need for you in my group at this time.~
@3020= ~Fine, but know this: If my blade does not work for ye, you'll likely end up with it against ye.~
@3021= ~A wise choice, indeed.  Puts off me having to kill you by a few days at least.  Move it wizard!  I'll not have us delayed by your flitting about.~
@3022= ~A wise choice, indeed.  Puts off me having to kill you by a few days at least.~
@3023= ~You came back!  Oh I just knew you would, especially after what we shared!  What was that again?  Oh pish, no matter.  All that is important is that we are back together as one big happy family.  You too Monty, let's go.~
@3024= ~As much as your mental state unnerves me, I do have need of your company once more.~
@3025= ~There will be a houseboat full of gibberling on every lake in the Realms before I accept the likes of you back.  Begone.~
@3026= ~You would tempt me so?  How cruel!  I shall pine away the days on this very spot lamenting your distinct lack of humanity.  And picking daisies.  Wheeeeee.~
@3027= ~Hurrah!  I'd have us all sing with joy, but I'm sure such an outpouring would come dangerously close to making me sick.  Onward, and all that.~
@3028= ~You old rumjake fool!  I knew you'd be back!  Let's get back to traveling the good road, eh?~
@3029= ~Sorry kiddo, but I don't need your company just yet.~
@3030= ~Sorry to have kept you waiting.  Lets get going.~
@3031= ~Oh fine!  I'll just pester about around here until you realize you can't live without little Imoen.  You know you will.~
@3032= ~You bet!  We'll nick ourselves a whole purse o' fun before the night is through!~
@3033= ~It's about time you got back!  Some nerve yous barrelheads have, leaving me standing here for so long.  It's a wonder I suffer your company at all.~
@3034= ~You'll not "suffer" long if you keep up that attitude.  Get in step Kagain, we've business to attend to.~
@3035= ~Well, you don't have to.  I don't need you back yet.~
@3036= ~Straight to the point, I respect that.  Let's go.~

@3042= ~Ah well, even the best things pass away.  Your company was enjoyable while it lasted.  Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@3043= ~It is good that you have returned, for there is much important work left to be done.~
@3044= ~Work that shall have to wait, I'm afraid.  I do not wish to have you back just yet.~
@3045= ~I would tend to agree.  Perhaps we should rejoin and continue on our way.~
@3046= ~That is your decision to make, but I won't wait an eternity.~
@3047= ~A wise choice.  Lead on.~
@3048= ~So you've come back, have you?  Perhaps we should join forces once again.  There is much work left to be done.~
@3049= ~That is an excellent idea.  Your sage advice and company have been missed.~
@3050= ~I have other plans for the moment.  Perhaps another time.~

@3054= ~A debt you have, but I do not wish to collect at this time.  Perhaps later.~
@3055= ~I do have need of you, but not because of your debt.  You skill is invaluable to me.~

@5000=~Insect Plague
Level: 5
School: Conjuration
Sphere: Animal
Range: Long
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, a mass of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm, first attacking the target, and then moving on to all enemies of the caster within the spell's radius. Invisibility is no protection.

For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victims suffer 2d3 points of damage from insect bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. death or run away in fear. If a successful save vs. breath at -4 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty.

This spell is blocked by any form of fire shield.~

Level: 7
School: Conjuration
Sphere: Animal
Range: Long
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, he calls forth a horde of venomous biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 feet of the target. Invisibility is no protection.

For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round, the victims suffer 2d6 points of damage from insect bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. death at -2 or run away in fear. If a successful save vs. breath at -6 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty.

@15035=~Sword Coast Stratagems (by David Wallace)

This is the auto-install program for Sword Coast Stratagems.
It allows you to quickly install the whole mod, based on some 
default choices. For each section of the mod (Spell tweaks, 
item tweaks, gameplay and ease-of-use tweaks, intelligence 
improvements, and tactical challenges), you'll be asked if you 
want to install that section, and then offered some customisation 
options before installing. After installation, if you want to change 
your installation options, run "setup-scs.exe" in your BG2 
directory and you'll be offered the option to add or remove 
individual components.

Press ENTER to continue.~

@15036=~You can also select the standard install method, which
asks you for each component whether you want to install it.

Alternatively, you can customise the install process by
editing the file "quick-install.ini", located in the BG2/scs
directory.
Just put "Yes" next to any component you want, and "No"
next to ones you don't want. (And don't put "Yes" next to
more than one option in any component).

Press ENTER to continue.~

@15037=~[4] Uninstall the mod~
